        <h4>Important Needs</h4>
          <p>The Hope Children Home Orphanage houses more than 50 talented children, aged 2 to 10. These children express a deep interest in the self development. Moreover they need to be looked after at all times. The need to satisfy their hygenic and diet needs is of crucial importance. We seek a helping hand.

        <h4>Giving Back To The Society</h4>
        <p>I spent time caring for or teaching young children who are living at the orphanage, during the holiday. Personally, I encourage giving back to the society, in various forms. I was not not worried about unskilled and untrained volunteers, because we are all in the journey of learning.
